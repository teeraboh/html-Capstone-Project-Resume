    <em
      >I enjoy playing games just as much as I enjoy writing code. <br />
      One of my favorite games is Call of Duty: Cold War. <br />
      This game helps me relax and process my thoughts, sparking creativity,
      <br />
      especially when I face a creative block or feel alone. <br />
      It serves as a perfect balance between relaxation <br />
      and mental stimulation.</em

      >Playing football on Saturday mornings is another hobby I cherish.
      <br />
      It helps me relax, stay fit, and, above all, build my social network.
      <br />
      The camaraderie and teamwork involved in the game provide a <br />
      refreshing break from my daily routine and contribute to my overall
      well-being.</em
